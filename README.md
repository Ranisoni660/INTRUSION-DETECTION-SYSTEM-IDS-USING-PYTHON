## Internship Project at Optifyx Technology
### Duration: 1 month

### Objective: Develop a comprehensive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect and alert on potential network threats.

### Description:
This project aimed to design and implement an IDS using Python, leveraging advanced libraries and techniques. The system monitors network traffic, identifies suspicious patterns, and alerts administrators via Twilio SMS and email notifications.

### Features:

- Network traffic monitoring
- Suspicious pattern detection
- Alert system for administrators via Twilio SMS and email
- Support for multiple network protocols

### Technologies Used:

- Python
- Scapy
- PyShark
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Twilio

### Twilio Integration:

- Send SMS alerts to administrators on threat detection
- Send email notifications with threat details
- Configure Twilio account settings 

### My Role:

As an intern at Optifyx Technology, I was responsible for:

- Designing and implementing the IDS
- Conducting research on network threats and detection techniques
- Integrating Twilio for alert notifications
- Collaborating with the team to integrate the IDS with existing security tools

### Outcomes:

- Successfully developed a functional IDS with Twilio integration
- Detected and alerted on various network threats
- Enhanced knowledge of network security principles and best practices

### Code Structure:

- Modular design for easy maintenance and updates
- Well-documented code for readability

### Future Development:

- Support for additional network protocols
- Integration with other security tools
- Improved detection accuracy and efficiency

### Usage

1. Configure the IDS by modifying the (link unavailable) file.
2. Run the IDS.
3. Monitor network traffic and alerts.

### Troubleshooting

1. Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
2. Verify Twilio API configuration.
3. Check logs for errors.

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make changes.
3. Submit a pull request.

### Security Considerations

1. Use caution when monitoring network traffic.
2. Ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
3. Keep the IDS up-to-date.

 This project was developed as part of an internship program at Optifyx Technology, aiming to enhance network security through advanced intrusion detection capabilities.
